Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.

__What does Machine Learning really means?__

Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.

The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. 


## Repository Overview
This repository is about different Machine Learning algorithm approaches as per the industry practices.

- Whatâ€™s the best (or at least the most popular) Halloween candy? That was the question this dataset was collected to answer. 
- Purpose is to find which is the most important component for a chocolate to be most popular. Also, predict the win percentage of the chocolate. 
- Python modules __pandas, seaborn,matplotlib,mlxtend, sklearn__ etc have been used, and finally different machine learning models are build to help the prediction. 
- Also, the best fit model for the given dataset is found based on the performance and accuracy of each models.

# Iris Data Analysis

- The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

- The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

- One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

- Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.
