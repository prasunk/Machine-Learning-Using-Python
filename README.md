Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.

__What does Machine Learning really means?__

Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.

The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. 


## Repository Overview
This repository is about different Machine Learning algorithm approaches as per the industry practices.

- Whatâ€™s the best (or at least the most popular) Halloween candy? That was the question this dataset was collected to answer. 
- Purpose is to find which is the most important component for a chocolate to be most popular. Also, predict the win percentage of the chocolate. 
- Python modules __pandas, seaborn,matplotlib,mlxtend, sklearn__ etc have been used, and finally different machine learning models are build to help the prediction. 
- Also, the best fit model for the given dataset is found based on the performance and accuracy of each models.
